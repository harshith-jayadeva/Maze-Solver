# Maze-Solver

This Program uses Breadth First Search and Depth First Search to Complete the maze. 

In this video, DFS is used to find a path to the end. However, this maze does not have a valid path to the end. The current path is indicated by the yellow squares, the blue squares indicate squares the program is going to check in the future, and the pink squares represent squares that the program has checked, but are not part of the current path. After the program has checked all of the squares, it tells the user a path cannot be found.
